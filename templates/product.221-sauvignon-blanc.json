They arrived on South African shores after completing an undefeated tour of France and the British colonies, expecting to continue their winning streak. The rugby world was rocked when a young unknown, 19-year-old Albertus Viljoen van der Merwe, “Alvi” to his friends, scored the first try in history against the All Blacks on African soil. <\/p><p>Our charismatic founder gripped the rugby world’s imagination by scoring this historic try, going on to be selected as the 221st player to play for the Springboks – South Africa’s national rugby team. With Alvi in their ranks, the Springboks turned the tide on “the invincibles”, going on to tour the UK and Europe undefeated. <\/p><p>Alvi’s farm in Worcester, South Africa, has continued this winning legacy, remaining family owned – and home to three generations of the Van der Merwe family – to this day. Today, the family farm is home to the Alvi’s Drift winery, known for producing internationally acclaimed, world-class wines of exceptional quality and value. <\/p><p>With our 221 range, we pay tribute to our patriarch, Oupa Alvi, and our phenomenal South African Springbok rugby team. <\/p>","button-txt":"VIEW ALL OUR 221 RANGE WINES","button_link":"shopify:\/\/collections\/221-range"}},"16439013861796ea6a":{"type":"Focus-Text-Image-Left","settings":{"our-story-vid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Vineyards-08.jpg","video_url":"","Heading_size":"h2","Heading_color":"#c0ccbe","title":"ON THE VINES","video-sec-content-txt-1":"<p>The grapes for our 221 Sauvignon Blanc wines are hand-harvested from carefully selected, prime vineyards on our wine farm.
