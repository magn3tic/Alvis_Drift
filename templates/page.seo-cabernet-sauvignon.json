Situated in the cool-climate wine ward of Scherpenheuvel, our Alvi’s Drift vineyards are sustainably fertilised with natural compost produced on our farm. <\/p><p>When harvest time comes, grapes are selectively hand-picked in the cool morning hours. This ensures that only the healthiest, perfectly ripe grapes are used to create our internationally acclaimed, award-winning Alvi’s Drift Cabernet Sauvignon red wine.<\/p><p>Once delivered to our cellar, hand-harvested Cabernet Sauvignon grapes are crushed, then transferred to fermentation tanks to ferment for around seven days. To enhance the wine’s colour and flavour, juice is drawn off on the skins, after which the Cabernet Sauvignon wine is selectively matured in French oak for up to eight months before it is bottled.<\/p>","button-txt":"","button_link":""}},"17978b07-1d98-4025-ac4f-88ea3ff52a52":{"type":"Focus-Text-Image-Right","settings":{"our-story-vid":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Cabernet_4.jpg","right_video_url":"","Heading_size":"h2","Heading_color":"#f8f2e6","title":"Experience Alvi’s Drift’s Award-Winning Cabernet Sauvignon Today","video-sec-content-txt-1":"<p>Cabernet Sauvignon red wine is a delicious red wine to enjoy by itself, but it is also perfect for food pairing.<\/p><p>Cabernet Sauvignon will complement a wide array of dishes, including spicy lamb chops, hearty oxtail stew and even freshly grilled tuna steak.<\/p><p>Visit our online shop today to sample our award-winning Alvi’s Drift Signature Cabernet Sauvignon, and get it delivered to your door.<\/p>","button-txt":"BUY OUR CABERNET SAUVIGNON","button_link":"shopify:\/\/products\/signature-cabernet-sauvignon"}},"1641813887d7289617":{"type":"Video-Grid","blocks":{"7c0f3f86-631d-4e23-af3b-8b3b887ea78d":{"type":"video","settings":{"video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=C_WqGqLwYfM&t=2s","description":"Spectacular South Africa Tasting","subheader":"Episode No","image_padding":false}},"730b0ae8-4188-4060-aeb2-a2bb75aead22":{"type":"video","settings":{"video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5R5LW4xmkk8&t=2s","description":"International Chardonnay Day","subheader":"Episode No","image_padding":false}},"6caa6da2-d101-4f8d-9a36-536ac029ff0e":{"type":"video","settings":{"video_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cFf802lx0Hs","description":"Virtual Chenin Blanc Tasting","subheader":"Episode No","image_padding":false}}},"block_order":["7c0f3f86-631d-4e23-af3b-8b3b887ea78d","730b0ae8-4188-4060-aeb2-a2bb75aead22","6caa6da2-d101-4f8d-9a36-536ac029ff0e"],"disabled":true,"settings":{"heading":"Directly from Alvi's Drift","background-colour":"#f6efe4"}},"16418135013991171e":{"type":"Blog-External","blocks":{"2759bbcd-a682-453a-b9d4-f2740399bc75":{"type":"article","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Alvi_s_Drift_Farm_2.jpg","title":"Viognier Wine is the Great South African Secret","content":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.alvisdrift.co.za\/viognier-wine-is-the-great-south-african-secret\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/blog.alvisdrift.co.za\/viognier-wine-is-the-great-south-african-secret\">All you need to know about viognier wine, plus a delicious curry recipe that's a perfect pairing.<\/a><\/p>","link":"https:\/\/blog.alvisdrift.co.za\/viognier-wine-is-the-great-south-african-secret"}},"d954890e-a745-45db-bd59-1d4235d987b2":{"type":"article","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Alvi_s_Drift_Wines.jpg","title":"The Nine Types of South African Wine","content":"<p><a href=\"https:\/\/blog.alvisdrift.co.za\/the-nine-types-of-south-african-wine\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https:\/\/blog.alvisdrift.co.za\/the-nine-types-of-south-african-wine\">You can learn the different types of wines according to their styles.
