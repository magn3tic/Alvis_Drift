So I was somewhat sceptical when I saw how reasonably priced this wine is, especially being part of a reserve collection.I was pleasantly surprised at my first sip, but after allowing the wine to breathe a bit in the glass, I was smitten! The wine is elegant, not overly wooded, not overly buttery, just the perfect blend of fruit and sophisticated oak. I’ve even introduced my son, an avid red wine drinker, and he responded with similar surprise (the good kind)!I’m also delighted to be supporting a family business and hope to continue stocking up on this beautiful wine for as long as my pocket (and lifespan) last.\"<\/p>","subtitle-2":"<p><em>- Lindi -<\/em><\/p>","button_text":"","button_link":"","new_tab":true}},"16392534101a01b24e":{"type":"Collections-Grid","blocks":{"16392534108f7600fd-0":{"type":"item","settings":{"collection_heading":"","collectionCarasoul":"white-wines"}}},"block_order":["16392534108f7600fd-0"],"settings":{"topheading":"OUR WHITE WINES","subtitle-1":"","active_collection":"white-wines"}}},"order":["1639248182bc55fb26","main","1639223856bcb87c3a","16392371564aec5ac1","1639224403b97d22e1","1639224916778fd50c","164389635627fdef41","1643896364ba99f2f9","1639226365ec4bf8dd","16392534101a01b24e"]}
